The files in this folder are examples of how you might configure solr.
They are largely copied verbatim from fulltextsearch-localsolr with
some changes added for search suggestions and search-as-you-type.

If you want to customise them just copy them to another folder or
ditch them entirely and change your extrasPath under Solr::configure_server.
