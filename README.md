Full features + documentation coming soon. Check the comments for now.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- Keyword search on multiple fields
- Remember search history
- Search suggestions
- Filter based on attributes (i.e. facet)
	- Facets need to be able to be different for different categories

- Faceting on price, etc.
